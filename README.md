## Aunka Time Cycle

This is very simple code to calculate the **aunka** date cycle.  This
is a calendar subsystem for my constructed language
[KÃ­lta](https://lingweenie.org/conlang/kilta.pdf).  There is no reason
for you to care about this unless you are for some wildly eccentric
reason planning to learn the language.

The package is `aunka`, which exports the functions `aunka` and
`aunka-string`.  Both give the **aunka** cycle for the current date,
in a list of keywords or a string, respectively.
